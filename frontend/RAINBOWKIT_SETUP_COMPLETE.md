     - `useAccount()` for address, isConnected, chainId
     - `useWalletClient()` for sending transactions
     - `usePublicClient()` for reading blockchain data
     - `useSwitchChain()` for network switching

## ðŸ”‘ Next Steps: Get Your Reown Project ID

To complete the setup, you need to get a **Reown Project ID** (formerly WalletConnect):

### How to Get Your Project ID:

1. Go to https://cloud.reown.com/
2. Sign up or log in
3. Create a new project
4. Copy your Project ID

### Add the Project ID to Your Environment:

Create a file `/frontend/.env.local` with:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_REOWN_PROJECT_ID=your_actual_project_id_here
```

Replace `your_actual_project_id_here` with the Project ID you got from Reown Cloud.

## ðŸš€ Testing Your Setup

1. Make sure you have the `.env.local` file with your Reown Project ID
2. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open your app in the browser
4. Click the "Connect Wallet" button in the header
5. You should see a modal with various wallet options including:
   - MetaMask
   - Coinbase Wallet
   - WalletConnect
   - And many more!

## ðŸŽ¨ What You Get with RainbowKit

RainbowKit provides:
- **Beautiful, ready-to-use UI** for wallet connections
- **Support for 100+ wallets** out of the box
- **Mobile wallet support** via WalletConnect
- **Chain switching** built-in
- **Responsive design** that works on all devices
- **Customizable themes** (you can customize later if needed)
- **ENS/UNS support** for displaying domain names instead of addresses

## ðŸ“¦ What Was Removed

The following are no longer needed and can be optionally deleted:
- `/src/contexts/BaseAccountContext.tsx` (replaced by wagmi hooks)
- Any Base Account SDK scripts or references

## ðŸ”§ Key Benefits

1. **More wallet options**: Users can now connect with MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow, Trust Wallet, and 100+ others
2. **Better UX**: Professional, tested wallet connection flow
3. **Less code to maintain**: RainbowKit handles all the complexity
4. **Industry standard**: Used by major DApps like Uniswap, Aave, etc.
5. **Better mobile support**: WalletConnect integration for mobile wallets

## ðŸŽ¯ Summary

Your app now uses:
- **RainbowKit** for wallet UI/UX
- **Wagmi** for React hooks and wallet interaction
- **Viem** for Ethereum interactions (low-level)
- **Reown (WalletConnect)** for mobile wallet connections

Everything is production-ready once you add your Reown Project ID!
